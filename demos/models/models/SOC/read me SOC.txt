Readme- Curtiss SOC Seagull

OK, this is a hobby, so the model I've made isn't perfect. Understanding, that I hope you get some enjoyment from it. I became intrigued by this quirky little "flying canoe" while modelling its "carrier"- a US Navy New Orleans class heavy cruiser. In the days before radar and helicopters, warships were often kitted out with various kinds of catapault-launched observation seaplanes. Today, some people go to great lengths to imagine bizarre "Steampunk" aircraft- but gee, "real" can be pretty strange too. The two-seater Curtiss Seagull floatplane saw service from 1935 to 1945. It had a wingspan of almost 11 metres and a cruising speed of 214kmh

The zipped package includes...
1. simple model in obj format
2. mapped materials for fuselage and wings. Use the mapped textures (incuding bump maps) or make your own with the map provided. 
3. Materials for wires and canopy glass- you can supply shaders etc for these.

Please, personal, non commercial use only. Please feel free to tinker with the mesh if you are so inspired.
